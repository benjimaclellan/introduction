## Open Source Projects
### OCT Image Reconstruction Software
A small example of the reconstruction algorithms used in Dr. Bizheva's Optical Biomedical Imaging Group at the University of Waterloo. The **[project]**(https://github.com/benjimaclellan/OCT-Image-Reconstruction) uses Python and is still under development.

### Monte-Carlo Simulation of a Protein Folding Model
A short, fun project which used a Monte-Carlo algorithm to simulate the folding of a simple H-P protein model. There is a Jupyter Notebook which steps through the code **[here]**(https://github.com/benjimaclellan/Protein-Folding-Toy-Model/blob/master/protein-folding-tutorial.ipynb)
